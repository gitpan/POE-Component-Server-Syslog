AUTHOR
    Matt Cashner (sungo@cpan.org)

SYNOPSIS
        POE::Component::Server::Syslog->spawn(
            Type        => 'udp', # or 'tcp'
            BindAddress => '127.0.0.1',
            BindPort    => '514',
            InputState  => \&input,
        );

        sub input {
            my $message = $_[ARG0];
            # .. do stuff ..
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This component provides very simple syslog services for POE.

METHODS
  spawn()
    Spawns a new listener. Requires one argument, "Type", which defines the
    subclass to be invoked. This value can be either 'tcp' or 'udp'. All
    other arguments are passed on to the subclass' constructor. See
    "POE::Component::Server::Syslog::TCP" and
    "POE::Component::Server::Syslog::UDP" for specific documentation. For
    backward compatibility, "Type" defaults to udp.
